# Image-Captioning-System
Image Captioning System to caption images and videos.

Given a image as input, the model will output a discriptive output for the image.

Use the trained model file named model_final.h5 to test using Image_Captioning_Testing_Code_Final.ipynb Some test images are provided in Image_captioning_test_images folder. Update the path in the code for its proper functioning.

The mode also works for videos. 

Uncomment the last cell in the code to use video as input
