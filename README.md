# Image-Captioning-System
Image Captioning Generator to caption images and videos.

Given an image as input, the model outputs a caption describing the image.

Use the trained model file named model_final.h5 to test using Image_Captioning_Testing_Code_Final.ipynb. Some test images are provided in the test_images folder. Update the path in the code for its proper functioning.

The mode also works for videos. 

Uncomment the last cell in the code to use video as input.
